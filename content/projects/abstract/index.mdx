Seeing beauty could be with your eyes, or with your heart. Either way, it depends mainly on your state of mind. Mine, tends to focus on positive thinking and attention to details. Reasons why I love abstract photographies. They seems to be doors to other dimensions, whereas they only are another view to reality.
